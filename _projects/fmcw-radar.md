## Overview

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of an FMCW radar system using MATLAB, with optional real-world testing via ADALM-PlutoSDR. The system performs beat frequency analysis to extract range and Doppler information from moving targets.

**Skills:** MATLAB, SDR, signal processing, chirp generation, FFT, radar theory

## Features

- Chirp waveform generation
- Time delay and Doppler shift simulation
- Range-Doppler processing via 2D FFT
- Optional PlutoSDR integration for hardware-in-the-loop testing
- Visualizations of heatmaps, return signals, and beat frequencies
